# Overview

Anemos is a CLI tool designed to simplify the management of Kubernetes manifests and
auxiliary resources. It lets you manage these resources using JavaScript or TypeScript,
providing a powerful and flexible way to define your infrastructure as code.

Other tools typically focus on management of a single package. But, Kubernetes
environments often consist of many applications, each with its own set of dependencies and
configuration. These configurations are scattered across multiple places, making it
difficult to manage and maintain them.

Anemos takes a different approach and allows you to create and manage your infrastructure as a whole.
It lets you:

- Generate Kubernetes manifests using a programming language, supporting both template-based
  and programmatic approaches.
- Integrate and configure multiple packages in a single codebase.
- Handle multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) in the same project.
- Define and manage service requirements and dependencies effectively.
- Modify Kubernetes manifests individually or in bulk after they are generated.

[Install](installation) the Anemos CLI to get started and follow the
[tutorial](category/tutorial) to explore its core concepts and features.
