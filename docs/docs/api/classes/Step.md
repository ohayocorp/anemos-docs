# Class: Step

Defined in: step.d.ts:54

A class that can be used to specify order of things in a flexible manner. This object consists of a
list of numbers. When two steps are compared, each number in their lists are compared according to their indexes.
If one of the lists do not have a number at an index, it is assumed to have 0.

For example, if (1, 2) is compared to (1), first the numbers at index 0 are compared. Since they are equal then the numbers
at index 1 are compared. The second step does not have a number at that index, so it is assumed that it has 0 and the first step
is determined to be greater than the second one.

This makes it possible to create a step between any two steps. For example, given two steps (1, 1), (1, 2),
the step (1, 1, 1) is between them.
