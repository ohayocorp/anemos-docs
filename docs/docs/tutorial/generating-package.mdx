# Generating a Package

Now that we can create manifests for our application in a reusable way, let's package our library so that
others can use it in their own projects.

Instead of modifying the existing application project, we will create a new package project. It will
have the necessary structure and files to be published as a package.

To create a package project, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    ```bash
    anemos new example-package --project-type package
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Structure of the package project is a bit different from the application project. The main difference is that
the package project is designed to be reusable and shareable, while the application project is meant to be
used for generating output files for a specific use case.

Package projects also have slightly different values in the `package.json` to match the package project
structure. We will not go into details about these files as the changes are minimal.

## Library Code (`lib` directory)

The `lib` directory contains the code that will be shared with the package. It consists of the necessary classes
and functions to generate the output files. It will also contain the public API definition for the package.

The files under the `lib` directory are very similar to the ones that we had created in the application project.
The main difference in manifest generation is that the package project template creates a pod instead of a
deployment and a service. The index file, on the other hand, serves a different purpose, so it will be structured differently.

Index file in the `lib` directory acts as the public API for the package. It exports the `Options` class and
an `add` function that takes a `Builder` and `Options`, creates a new `Component` using the given options and adds it to the
given `Builder`. The `Component` class will not be exported, as it is not part of the public API and is only used internally
by the package.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="lib/index.js" showLineNumbers>
        {LibIndexJs}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Test Code (`test` directory)

Package project template includes a `test` directory that contains the code to
generate output files with the package. The test cases act like small applications
that use the package to generate output files, allowing us to verify its behavior.

Inside the `test` directory, you will find the index file that serves as the entry point for
the test cases. It imports all the test cases and runs them one by one.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="test/index.js" showLineNumbers>
        {TestIndexJs}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Each test case is defined as a separate module inside its own directory. Anemos
creates a simple test case under the `basic` directory.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="test/basic/index.js" showLineNumbers>
        {BasicIndexJs}
    </CodeBlock>

    Contents of the `test/basic/index.js` file is similar to the `index.js` file in the application project.
    The only notable difference is the `require` statements at the top of the file. Instead of importing
    the `Component` and `Options` classes from the `component.js` and `options.js` files, the package's public
    API is imported from the `lib` directory.

    When you run the build command, the tests that are defined inside the `test/index.js` will be executed.
    The output files will be generated in the `test/basic` directory. You can check them to verify that the
    package works as expected.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Publishing the Package

Run the following command to directly publish the package to the official NPM registry:

```bash
anemos package publish
```

You can also use the following command to build the package as a tarball file, which you can then
publish manually or share with others:

```bash
anemos package pack
```

This command requires you to have an NPM account and be logged in. If you haven't done this yet,
you can create an account on the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) and log in using the command:

```bash
anemos package login
```

:::tip
If you want to publish the package to a private registry, you can use the `--registry` option
with the `anemos package publish` command. For example:

```bash
anemos package login --registry https://my-private-registry.com
anemos package publish --registry https://my-private-registry.com
```
