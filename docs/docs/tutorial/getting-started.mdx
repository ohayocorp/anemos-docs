# Getting Started

In this tutorial, we will create an Anemos project that generates Kubernetes manifests for
an example application. We will start simple and generate the manifests in the main script. Then,
gradually we will refactor the code into a more modular structure. Lastly, we will generate a package
that can be reused by other projects.

## Creating a New Project

To create a new Anemos project, you can use the `anemos new` command. This command will create a new directory
with the necessary files for an Anemos project.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Shell">
    ```bash
    anemos new example
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new directory called `example` with a single `index.js` file. `index.js` is the main script of the project.
This is where we will write our code to generate the Kubernetes manifests.

## Building the Project

To generate the Kubernetes manifests from your Anemos project, use the `anemos build`
command:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Shell">
    ```bash
    anemos build index.js
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command instructs Anemos to perform the build process that effectively runs the `index.js` file.

The generated resources will be placed in the `output` directory. For the default template, this
will initially contain a single Pod manifest.

:::note
By default, the `output` folder will be created in the directory where your main script is located. If you want
to specify a different output directory, you can set it in the builder options.

Output directory must be inside the directory where your main script is located.
:::

:::warning
The `output` directory is managed by Anemos and its contents are deleted
before each build. Do not store any manually created files in this directory.

## Visual Studio Code

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the [Anemos VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ohayocorp.anemos)
to get intellisense and build your project. Plugin provides `anemos.build` command that you can run from the command palette
to build the `index.js` file on the root of your project. It also includes a default keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+E Ctrl-A</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+E Cmd+A</kbd>.
