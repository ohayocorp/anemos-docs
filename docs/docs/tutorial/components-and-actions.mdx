# Components and Actions

In Anemos, the generation process is orchestrated by a `Builder`. `Builder` consists of
multiple `Component` objects. Each `Component` represents a logical unit of work,
often corresponding to a specific application or a configuration task. `Component` objects
themselves are composed of multiple `Action`s. `Action`s are functions that are
responsible for performing specific tasks in a defined sequence.

When `Builder.build()` is called, all actions from all components are collected, sorted by their steps,
and executed sequentially. Following diagram illustrates the execution flow of a `Builder`.
More detailed information about the execution of steps can be found in [Execution Order](../reference/execution-order.mdx).

## Components

A `Component` encapsulates a set of operations needed for a specific application or task.
For example, you might have a component for generating backend service manifests, or a component
that modifies ingress resources to add some specific annotations. Each component can be thought
of as a plugin that can be added to the `Builder` to extend its functionality.

Components are generally defined by extending the `Component` class. It is also possible to
create a component using the constructor directly, but extending the
`Component` class encapsulates the logic and provides a cleaner interface.

The `Component` class provides methods to manage actions. It is designed to be flexible and
extensible, allowing you to create custom components that fit your specific needs.

### Creating a Custom Component

To create a custom component, you extend the `Component` class and add the necessary
actions within its constructor. The `Component` class provides the `addAction` method to register
these actions along with their steps. Let's create a new file and define a custom component:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="component.js" showLineNumbers>
        {ComponentEmptyJs}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Actions

Components themselves don't perform tasks; they serve as containers for actions. Actions do the actual work,
such as generating documents, modifying existing ones, or performing other operations.

Actions are executed in a specific order, defined when adding them to a component using the `addAction` method.
This sequence is important, as dependencies might exist between tasks (e.g. generating resources
before modifying them). Anemos provides predefined steps like `steps.generateResources`
and `steps.modify` to help manage common sequences.

Actions are simple functions that accept a `BuildContext` object as an argument. The `BuildContext`
provides access to shared state, builder options, existing documents generated during previous steps,
and other utilities necessary for the action's execution.

Let's add an action to our custom component. We will move the code from the previous section that generates
the Kubernetes manifests into the action. This will allow us to generate the documents when the action is executed.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="component.js" showLineNumbers>
        {ComponentJs}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Instead of using `builder.addDocument`, we are now using `context.addDocument` to add documents to the context.

The `builder.addDocument` method that was used in the previous sections is a shorthand for creating a component
that adds the given document to the context during the `steps.generateResources` step. It is similar to the following code block:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    ```javascript showLineNumbers
    const component = new anemos.Component();

    component.addAction(anemos.steps.generateResources, (context) => {
        context.addDocument(document);
    });

    builder.addComponent(component);
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

Now that we have defined our custom component, we can use it in our main script. Replace the previous code that generates
the Kubernetes manifests in the main script with the following code that creates an instance of our custom component
and adds it to the builder:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="index.js" showLineNumbers>
        {IndexJs}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, run Anemos build to generate the manifests and see that the output is the same as before:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    ```bash
    anemos build index.js
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
