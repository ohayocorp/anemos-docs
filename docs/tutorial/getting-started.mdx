# Getting Started

In this tutorial, we will create an Anemos project that generates Kubernetes manifests for
an example application. We will start simple and generate the manifests in the main script. Then,
gradually we will refactor the code into a more modular structure. Lastly, we will generate a package
that can be reused by other projects.

## Creating a New Project

To create a new Anemos project, you can use the `anemos new` command. This command will create a new directory
with the necessary files for an Anemos project. You can specify the language you want to use for the project
by using the `--language` flag. The available languages are `typescript` and `javascript`. This tutorial has
both TypeScript and JavaScript examples. You can choose either one based on your preference.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    anemos new example --language typescript
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    ```bash
    # JavaScript is the default language, so you can omit the --language flag.
    anemos new example
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new directory called `example` with the following structure:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    example
    ├── .anemos
    ├── .vscode
    ├── node_modules
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── bun.lock
    ├── index.ts
    ├── package.json
    ├── tsconfig.json
    ```

    - `.vscode` directory contains the configuration files for Visual Studio Code for a better
      development experience.
    - `.anemos/types` directory contain the type declarations for Anemos standard
      library. These files are not used by Anemos, but they are useful for IDEs to provide type hints
      and autocompletion.
    - `package.json` and `bun.lock` files and `node_modules` directory are used to manage the dependencies
      of the project. Anemos uses the JavaScript package management system so that you can use any JavaScript
      library in your project. We will see package management in later sections.
    - `.gitignore` file is used to ignore files and directories that should not be included in the version
      control system.
    - `tsconfig.json` file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler. Anemos creates this file with some
      default values, but you can modify it to fit your needs.
    - `index.ts` is the main script of the project. This is where we will write our code to generate the
      Kubernetes manifests.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    ```bash
    example
    ├── .anemos
    ├── .vscode
    ├── node_modules
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── bun.lock
    ├── index.js
    ├── package.json
    ```

    - `.vscode` directory contains the configuration files for Visual Studio Code for a better
      development experience.
    - `.anemos/types` directory contain the type declarations for Anemos standard
      library. These files are not used by Anemos, but they are useful for IDEs to provide type hints
      and autocompletion.
    - `package.json` and `bun.lock` files and `node_modules` directory are used to manage the dependencies
      of the project. Anemos uses the JavaScript package management system so that you can use any JavaScript
      library in your project. We will see package management in later sections.
    - `.gitignore` file is used to ignore files and directories that should not be included in the version
      control system.
    - `index.js` is the main script of the project. This is where we will write our code to generate the
      Kubernetes manifests.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Building the Project

To generate the Kubernetes manifests from your Anemos project, use the `anemos build`
command:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    anemos build --tsc . dist/index.js
    ```
    
    This command instructs Anemos to perform the build process. Let's break down the arguments:
    - `--tsc .`: This argument tells Anemos to use the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the
      TypeScript code. The `.` indicates that the current directory is the source directory for
      the TypeScript files.
    - `dist/index.js`: This is the path where the compiled JavaScript output will be placed
      and subsequently executed by Anemos.

    Executing this command will:
    1.  Compile the TypeScript code found in the current directory (`.`) into JavaScript.
    1.  Place the compiled output into `dist/index.js`.
    1.  Run the compiled JavaScript file (`dist/index.js`) to generate the Kubernetes resources.
    
    The generated resources will be placed in the `dist/output` directory. For the default template, this
    will initially contain a single Pod manifest.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    ```bash
    anemos build index.js
    ```

    This command instructs Anemos to perform the build process that effectively runs the `index.js` file.
    
    The generated resources will be placed in the `output` directory. For the default template, this
    will initially contain a single Pod manifest.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
By default, the `output` folder will be created in the directory where your main script is located.
For TypeScript projects, this is the directory that contains the compiled JavaScript code, typically `dist`.
For JavaScript projects, it is the same directory as your main script.

If you want to specify a different output directory, you can set it in the builder options or you can use
`ANEMOS_OUTPUT_PATH` environment variable to specify the output directory relative to the main script.

Output directory must be inside the directory where your main script is located.
:::

:::warning
The `output` directory is managed by Anemos and its contents are deleted
before each build. Do not store any manually created files in this directory.
:::

## Visual Studio Code

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the built-in task runner to build your project. Anemos
configures the build task for the project when you run `anemos new`. You can add the following keybinding
to your `keybindings.json` file to run that task with a shortcut.

Bring up the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and select
`Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`. Then, add the following keybinding to the file:

```json
[
  // Your other keybindings...
  {
      "key": "ctrl+f5", // Or your preferred shortcut
      "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
      "args": "build",
      "when": "config.anemos.enabled"
  }
]
```

This allows you to quickly rebuild your Anemos project using the configured task directly from VS Code.

## TypeScript

Here's a brief overview of TypeScript options Anemos sets up for you with the `tsconfig.json` file when you create a new project:

:::note
Anemos uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) since it is much faster
(like 10x) than running the TypeScript compiler with Goja runtime.
:::

- Target is set to `ES2017`. Anemos uses a JavaScript runtime called [Sobek](https://github.com/grafana/sobek/),
  which is a fork of [Goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja), that supports ES2017 features. It may also have support for
  features on later standards. You can check the supported features on [Goja's GitHub page](https://github.com/dop251/goja).
- Module is set to `NodeNext` so that TypeScript compiler generates JavaScript code with CommonJS modules. Anemos doesn't
  support ES modules yet, so you need to use CommonJS modules in your projects.
- The `strict` option is set to `true` so that TypeScript compiler will enable a wide range of type checking behaviors. This helps
  catching type errors early in the development process.
- The `declaration` option is set to `true` so that TypeScript compiler generates type declarations for the package.
- The `outDir` option is set to `./dist`. This is where the compiled JavaScript code will be written.
- The `inlineSourceMap` option is set to `true` so that the source maps are generated for the compiled code. This will provide
  better stack traces in case of errors.
