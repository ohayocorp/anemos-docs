# Execution Order

## Steps

Anemos uses a class called `Step` to sort actions flexibly. The `Step` class has a description
(for logging) and a list of numbers.

When comparing two `Step` objects, the numbers in their respective lists are compared index by index.
If one list is shorter than the other, missing numbers at higher indices are treated as 0 for comparison.

For example, comparing `[1, 2]` with `[1]`:
1.  Index 0: Both have `1`. They are equal.
1.  Index 1: The first step has `2`, the second has no number (treated as `0`). Since `2 > 0`,
the first step `[1, 2]` is considered *greater than* the second step `[1]`.

This system allows for fine-grained control over execution sequence. Consider these standard steps
provided by Anemos:

-   `generateResources`: `[5]`
-   `generateResourcesBasedOnOtherResources`: `[5, 1]`
-   `modify`: `[6]`

Comparing these:
-   `generateResources` [5] is less than `modify` [6] because `5 < 6`.
-   `generateResourcesBasedOnOtherResources` [5, 1] is greater than `generateResources` [5] because at index 1, `1 > 0`.
-   `generateResourcesBasedOnOtherResources` [5, 1] is less than `modify` [6] because at index 0, `5 < 6`.

This structure allows inserting custom steps between existing ones. For instance, a step like
`[5, 1, 1]` would execute *after* `[5, 1]` but *before* `[5, 2]`. Similarly, `[5, 0, 1]` would run *after* `[5]` but *before* `[5, 1]`.

## Executing Actions

The `Builder` orchestrates the execution of actions. When you call the `build()` method:
1.  It collects all actions from all added components.
2.  It sorts these actions based on their assigned `Step`.
3.  It executes the actions sequentially in the sorted order.

### Example: Execution Order in Practice

Consider the following example components:

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="typescript" title="index.ts" showLineNumbers>
        {ExecutionOrderTs}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
    <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="index.js" showLineNumbers>
        {ExecutionOrderJs}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example:
-   `App1Component` adds an action with step `generateResources`.
-   `App2Component` adds an action with step `generateResources`.
-   `SetNodeNameComponent` adds an action with step `modify`.

When `builder.build()` is called:
1.  The actions are collected.
2.  They are ordered by their steps: `generateResources` `[5]` comes before `modify` `[6]`.
3.  Execution proceeds:
    -   The `generateResources` action from `App1Component` runs.
    -   The `generateResources` action from `App2Component` runs.
    -   The `modify` action from `SetNodeNameComponent` runs.

Even if `SetNodeNameComponent` was added to the builder *before* `App1Component` or `App2Component`,
its `modify` action runs *after* their `generateResources` actions due to the defined `Step` ordering.

For actions that run during the *same* `Step` (like the two `generateResources` actions), their relative
execution sequence is determined by the order in which their parent components were added to the
`Builder`. Since `App1Component` was added first, its `generateResources` action runs before the one
from `App2Component`.
